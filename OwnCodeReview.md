### Some ideas after learning coding things

- SQL queries is better to keep in DB to not search all across the code.
- Colors and strings would be good to keep in variables of dictionaries. Same reason as above.
- Naming (cases) is strange kinda.
- Add more try/catch statement.
- Same icons in different directories.
- SQL queries (C# methods) are not in one file.
- Need more comments.
